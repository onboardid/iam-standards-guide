# Launching the IAM Standards Guide

We're excited to announce the launch of **The Definitive Identity and Access Management Standards Guide** - a comprehensive, vendor-agnostic reference for IAM standards that the community has been asking for.

<!-- truncate -->

## The Problem We're Solving

When a respected IAM professional recently posted on LinkedIn asking *"Is there a vendor-agnostic IAM architecture mapped to open standards?"*, the community response was immediate and overwhelming - people are "begging for it."

Organizations waste **40-60 hours per project** researching fragmented IAM standards information across IETF RFCs, W3C specifications, OASIS standards, vendor documentation, and blog posts. This leads to wrong technology choices ($50K-$200K annual waste), compliance failures, and security vulnerabilities.

**We built the comprehensive resource the industry desperately needs.**

## What We've Launched

### 29 IAM Standards Documented

We've documented 29 essential IAM standards across 9 functional areas:

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- OAuth 2.0 (RFC 6749) - Universal authorization framework
- OpenID Connect - Authentication layer, ISO/IEC 26131:2024
- PKCE (RFC 7636) - Mandatory OAuth security (OAuth 2.1)
- SAML 2.0 - Enterprise SSO (20 years old, still growing!)
- FIDO2/WebAuthn - Passwordless authentication (15B+ accounts support passkeys)

**OAuth Security Extensions:**
- DPoP (RFC 9449) - Token binding to prevent theft
- PAR (RFC 9126) - Request confidentiality (FAPI 2.0 requirement)
- RAR (RFC 9396) - Fine-grained authorization

**And 21 more standards** across Provisioning, Directory Services, Authorization Policy, Security Profiles, Decentralized Identity, and Workload Identity.

### Industry-Specific Guidance

**Financial Services:** FAPI 2.0 compliance stack, PSD2/Open Banking requirements
**Healthcare:** SMART on FHIR mandates, HIPAA considerations
**Government:** iGov profile, NIST 800-63, FedRAMP, eIDAS 2.0

### Decision Support Tools

**Decision Trees:**
- "Which authentication standard should I use?" - Get recommendations based on your use case
- "Which authorization standard?" - OAuth vs policy engines (OPA, Cedar, OpenFGA)

**Historical Timeline:** See how standards evolved from 1988 (X.509, Kerberos) through 2025 (FAPI 2.0, Verifiable Credentials, RISC)

**Relationship Diagrams:** Understand how OAuth 2.0 ecosystem connects (OIDC, PKCE, DPoP, PAR, RAR, FAPI)

## What Makes This Different

✅ **Vendor-Agnostic** - Focused on open standards and open-source projects, not proprietary solutions

✅ **Multiple Audiences** - Plain-language for executives, technical depth for architects, implementation guidance for developers

✅ **Comprehensive Temporal View** - Historical context (why OIDC replaced OpenID 2.0), current adoption, future outlook

✅ **Human AND Non-Human Identity** - Covers workload identity (SPIFFE/SPIRE), service-to-service authentication, not just human authentication

✅ **Compliance Mapping** - Maps standards to NIST 800-63, PSD2, HIPAA, GDPR, FedRAMP

## Initial Coverage Stats

- **29 Standards Documented** (~6,500 lines of content)
- **9 Functional Categories**
- **6 Adoption Levels** (Universal → Experimental)
- **6 Standards Bodies** (IETF, W3C, OpenID Foundation, OASIS, CNCF, ITU)
- **3 Industry Guides** (Financial, Healthcare, Government)
- **2 Decision Trees** (Authentication, Authorization)

## Technical Foundation

Built on **Docusaurus 3.x** with:
- Structured metadata schema (validated on every build)
- Full-text search
- Mobile-responsive design
- Automated link checking
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Deployed on Vercel with analytics

## What's Next

**Content Expansion:**
- Additional industry guides (Higher Education, Enterprise B2B, Consumer)
- Migration guides (SAML→OIDC, Password→Passkeys, OAuth 2.0→2.1)
- More standards (50+ target for comprehensive coverage)
- Comparison tools, quick-start guides

**Platform Features:**
- Advanced search and filtering
- Interactive visualizations
- PDF export capabilities
- Community contributions

## Get Involved

This is a living resource that will evolve as IAM standards evolve. We welcome:

- **Suggestions** - Missing a critical standard? Let us know
- **Contributions** - See our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/onboardid/iam-standards-guide/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Thank You

To the IAM community for validating this need and inspiring us to build what you've been asking for.

Special thanks to the original LinkedIn poster whose question sparked this project, and to the standards bodies (IETF, W3C, OpenID Foundation, OASIS, FIDO Alliance, CNCF) whose work we document.
