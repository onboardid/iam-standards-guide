## Why This Guide Exists

When a respected IAM professional posted on LinkedIn asking "Is there a vendor-agnostic IAM architecture mapped to open standards?", the community response was overwhelming - people are **"begging for it."**

Despite excellent frameworks like FICAM and IDPro Body of Knowledge, no single resource directly answers:
1. **Which open standards** support which IAM processes
2. **Where gaps/overlaps exist** in standards coverage
3. **Specific open-source projects** implementing these standards

This guide fills that gap.
