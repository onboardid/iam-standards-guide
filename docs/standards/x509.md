# X.509

## Summary

**Purpose:** Digital certificate format underpinning PKI and all HTTPS connections

**Adoption:** Universal - most critical identity standard, every HTTPS connection uses X.509 certificates

**Plain-Language:** X.509 certificates are the digital "ID cards" that prove websites, servers, and services are who they claim to be. Every time you see the padlock icon in your browser (HTTPS), X.509 certificates are protecting that connection. Over 3 billion certificates issued by Let's Encrypt alone.

## Technical Details

- **Certificate Format:** Version 3 (since 1996), unchanged and continuously enhanced
- **Use Cases:** TLS/SSL (all HTTPS), S/MIME email, code signing, VPN, WiFi (802.1X), IoT device identity
- **Certificate Authorities:** Trusted third parties issuing certificates (Let's Encrypt, DigiCert, GlobalSign)
- **Certificate Lifetimes:** Maximum 398 days currently, proposals to reduce to 47 days by 2029

**Critical Infrastructure:** Unlike legacy protocols, X.509 faces no viable replacement. It's been continuously enhanced rather than displaced.

## Industry Usage

**Universal:** Every device, server, service on the internet
**Government:** US Federal PKI Common Policy Framework
**Enterprise:** Internal PKI for employee certificates, device authentication
